# banking_ledger_sample
This MEAN stack app implements a simple banking ledger and uses secure login/logout via passport/JWT including salting and hashing of passwords. It uses a local JSON file for account storage rather than a database. It additionally uses FontAwesome icons and Bootstrap 4 for styling.
